# Ch1mpleo – Visual Portfolio

A personal corner of the internet where I have fun, experiment with creative dev stuff, and show off my love for video games.

Orginal idea come from [Antoine Wodniack] — remixed and made my own.

## What this is

This isn't a formal portfolio. It's a playground.

I'm a **Gamer and Developer** who codes by day and games by night. This site is where those two worlds collide — a space to try out wild animations, experiment with design, and keep a piece of the internet that feels like *me*.

*Made with ☕, late nights, and too many game references.*
